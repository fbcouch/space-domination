Some Feedback/TODO:
- revisit adding velocity of ship to velocity of bullets
- faster laser recharge time
- refuelable missles?
- figure out how to warn players they're going off-screen or help them get back on more easily
- max width/height for screen?
- possibility of using ion cannons to disable ships then salvage for upgrades
- keyboard controls for all menus
- flipping fighter
- options menu needs to return to pause menu while in game
- damage decay of lasers?
