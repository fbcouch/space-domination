I'll make this a more formal readme in future releases. Right now, I'm sure you just want to know how to run the game.

For Windows users, just double click "SpaceDominationMain.py"

or, for all systems, open a console/shell, navigate to the SpaceDomination folder and type:
	
	python SpaceDominationMain.py

Thanks, everyone!
