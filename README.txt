AUTHOR NOTES:
	Thanks everyone for trying out my game, Space Domination. It is my sincere hope that you have an enjoyable experience.
	If you tried version 0.1, there are several new features in 0.2:
		- You may change your Callsign and the height/width of the game window on the "Options" screen
		- Improved AI
		- A new mission featuring a Space Station
		- New graphics (of course, subject to wild changes in the future at my discretion :) )
		- Multiple weapons (swap between them with the 1 and 2 number keys at the top of the keyboard)
	Look for version 0.3 coming soon!
	
	Thanks,
		Jami Couch
